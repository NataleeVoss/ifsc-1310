  <h2>Segway Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <!--In this assignment I ask that you collect feedback from a peer, 
  family member, or a friend on your first attempt at the Dragon or
  Segway project. Using that feedback, I'd like you to attempt to address
  any issues or problems pointed out by your potential users.-->
  <h3>Experience During the Semester</h3><p>During this semester, I feel like I 
  learned much more than what I thought I was going to. At first, it was a bit 
  intemidating because the information being covered was so new and it seemed 
  so complicated. However, as the semester progressed, I learned that as long as 
  I followed along, payed attention, and looked up examples outside of class, I 
  was able to learn how to write the codes! Lastly, I feel like this class has 
  helped me build my confidence in web technology because I now have a more firm 
  understanding as to what is being put into a website.</p><h3>What were the
  things you did well on the project?</h3><p>I believe that the things I did really well on this
  project were maintaining a solid color and font scheme throughout the website. 
  I feel like I did this well because I began the project with the idea that
  since I was trying to catch the eye of young adults, especially college
  students, I should create a straight forward site that is pleasing to the eye. 
  Not only this, but I also wanted to create something that was calm in colors 
  because an audience of this type is usually under stress and would not enjoy 
  a user experience that involved a color "screaming" at them as they attempted 
  to navigate throught the site.</p><h3>What would you do differently if you had to startover?</h3>
  <p>If I had to start all the way over, I would find a better way to portray 
  the images in my site. Although I am very proud of how they look, I feel like 
  I could learn a way to make them appear smoother.</p><h3>Feedback Recieved and Changes Addressed</h3>
  <p>The feedback that I recieved about my site actually somewhat surprised me. 
  My friend thought that my site was very "professional". She also said that if there was
  anything that she thinks I should add or change it would be adding a video. 
  I decided to take her honest input and go take a look at the changes she suggested that I make. After overlooking the site, 
  I felt that the changes were not necessary. Since they were so minute, I felt like 
  those changes were something that each user may have a different opinion on and, 
  although I feel like every opinion counts, you just can not jeapardize the overall 
  look and feel of the site in order to please everyone.</p>
  <!--Also report on the feedback you received and what you did to address those
  issues or why you chose not to make the recommended changes.-->
  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive enhancement is using code in a way that allows all users to obtain the full experience of what is being portrayed on the web.
  I think that progressive enhancement is important in modern web development because it allows users to engage with the web in a similar manner. Without it, it would not be such a nice experience for many users because they would not get to see what all content is available to interact with in the web.
