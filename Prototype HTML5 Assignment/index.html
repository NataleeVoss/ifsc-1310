        <h2>Properly Creating the Content of an HTML5 Document</h2>
        
        <p>When you are creating the content for an HTML5 document, you must include specific information.
        The information has to be precise because it is what persuades the users to return to the site.
        Some of this information includes headers, paragraphs, and the proper use of semantics. However, 
        you <strong>cannot</strong> properly include this information without the use of tags. </p>
        
        <h3>What are Tags?</h3>
        
        <p>Tags are short commands that are used in order to correctly assign text with specific roles. 
        Each tag is opened by using angle brackets, and closed by using a forward slash enclosed in angle brackets.
        For instance, the table below includes different types of tags, the reasons for using them, and examples 
        of opening and closing those tags.</p>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <table>
        <tr><th scope="col">TAG</th>
        <th scope="col">REASON FOR USE</th>
        <th scope="col">COMMONLY USED?</th>
        <th scope="col">EXAMPLE OF OPENED TAG/BRACKET</th>
        <th scope="col">EXAMPLE OF CLOSED TAG/BRACKET</th></tr>
        <tr><td><></td><td>This is an example of angle brackets. They are used in order to show that a tag is either being opened or closed.</td>
        <td>Yes</td><td><></td><td><></td></tr>
        <tr><td>p</td><td>This is used in order to show that a paragraph is being formed.</td><td>Yes</td><td>p</td><td>/p</td></tr>
        <tr><td>table</td><td>You use this in order to show that you are opening a table.</td><td>Yes</td><td>table</td><td>/table</td></tr>
        <tr><td>h5</td><td>This tag is used to establish a header that pertains to what is being said,
        but does not hold key information, i.e. a subsection of a subsection of another subsection.</td><td>No</td><td>h5</td><td>/h5</td></tr>
        <tr><td>h1</td><td>Although this tag looks similar to the previous one, it is more emphasized because it shows
        the importance of a level 1 header.</td><td>Yes</td><td>h1</td><td>/h1</td></tr>
        </table>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <h4>The Information Between the Tags</h4>
        
        <p>Between <strong>each</strong> tag there is a key piece of information that will be portrayed onto the page. This 
        information can range anywhere from a sentence to an image, or even a list. Below are examples of lists, as well as an image.
        The first list is known as an ordered list because it is ordered by numbers.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Example</li>
            <li>Ordered</li>
            <li>List</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        
        The second list is called an unordered list because it is listed through the use of bullets.
        
        <ul>
            <li>Example</li>
            <li>Unordered</li> 
            <li>List</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        
        The third type of list is declared as a description list.
        
        <dl>
            <dt>Description List Example</dt>
            
            <dd>The description list is used to describe specific things.</dd>
        </dl>
        <br>

        <h2>How to Avoid Plagiarism</h2>
        <h3>Avoiding Plagiarism While Inputting Quotes</h3>
        <p> are put into an HTML5 document by using specific tags. These tags 
            are called "blockquote" and "cite" they allow you to properly repeat the quote without risking plagiarism. 
            Within each "blockquote" tag, you must open a "cite" tag so that you will be able to 
            cite your source(s). Here's an example:</p> <blockquote>Quote's are quite quotey if you quote about it. 
            <cite>From Creating an HTML5 Document with Natalee Voss</cite></blockquote>
        
       <h3>Avoiding Plagiarism While Inputting Images</h3>
        <p>
           At times, it is necessary to include images within your HTML5 document. In order to include images,
           you have to include, can you guess it? <em>Tags!</em> The tags that are used in order to input 
           an image are "img src=", and "alt". Img src stands for "image source" and it is followed by the link to the 
           page where the image is from. The "alt" tag stands for alternative and it is where you can describe what the 
           name/description of the image is. Look at this example: 
           <br>
           <img src="https://thomaswallace.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gordo.jpeg" alt="Gordo the Space Monkey" />
        </p>
        
        <h5>The Sizes of Imagery</h5>
        <p>It is important to keep in mind how large your image is going to be on your document. An image that
          is too large can cause loading problems, as well as an oversized cognative load on the user(s).</p>
